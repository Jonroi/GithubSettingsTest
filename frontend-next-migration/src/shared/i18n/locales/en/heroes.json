  "desensitizerDescription": "An unchanging shield. The shield explodes when hit enough times (with more durability for better characters). Once the shield has exploded, the character can no longer block a missile but can activate/deactivate a teammate's shield or launch a missile.",
  "tricksterDescription": "The missile randomly changes direction when it hits the shield, making it difficult to predict where the missile will go.",
  "obedientDescription": "The shield never changes, and the missile always leaves the shield at a certain angle, repeating the same pattern. Each character in this class has one specific angle at which the missile can be launched. It always returns the missile speed to the middle level. (The shape of the shield may differ for different characters, but there is only one direction.)",
  "projectorDescription": "Directs the missile to a teammate. Works well with a play style where one player takes the missile and the other aims. The more the character's shield is hit, the bigger and more permanent the smoke cloud it forms, making it harder for a teammate to settle into position.",
  "retroflectorDescription": "The shield never disappears, even when close to another. The shield gradually becomes harder to control with each hit. The shape of the shield differs between characters, and the character dies when all changes to the shield have been exhausted.",
  "intellectualizerDescription": "When a missile hits the shield, it forms lines on the field showing the missile's path. The lines help with aiming. The more it happens, the longer the lines remain on the field, and it becomes harder to distinguish them from previous lines or they start to obscure the view. The shield shape does not change.",
  "confluentDescription": "Forms a bubble around itself and a teammate. Aiming with the shield is unpredictable because the shape of the shield alternates between a round and a burst bubblegum bubble. (This will be implemented later after other features are tested and approved by testers: it pulls the teammate towards it more strongly the more the shield is used.)",
